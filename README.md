# Movie/Image Project

## DESCRITPION:
### This project is a short 1 to 2 minute clip that I created for my class. It is more like a stop motion clip where images are taken of each scene and put together in order to tell a narrative. 

## LICENSE:
### Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 / CC BY 3.0 US DEED

I chose this license due to my project being a sort of film. It gives the public the ability to use the film as long as attribution/credit is appropriately given to the creator.
